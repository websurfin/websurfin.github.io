Hi there, I am Tommy White. This website is meant to serve as a professional portfolio of sorts for me as I make the transition into the CS industry.

Here are the footnotes about me:
* I am originally from Bellevue, Washington, a suburb of Seattle
* I graduated with my undergraduate degree from Cal Poly SLO with a major in computer science with a minor in data science
* After a few years as a PhD student/research assistant, I now plan to graduate with a masters in computer science by December of 2021
* I am now [looking for work](/about/#looking-for-work), starting immediately, in the fields of machine learning, data science/engineering, cybersecurity, or more general backend software engineering. 
    * Skills include Python (including pandas/numpy/keras/sklearn/etc), Java, LaTex/Markdown, C/C++, Git, R/ggplot, Linux/bash programming and more.
    * [See here for my resume](https://github.com/websurfin/hire-me/blob/main/latex/resume/main.pdf), as available publicly, on Github. Reach out to me if you need more details than I make available here.
* Hobbies include skiing/snowboarding, surfing, paddleboarding, playing soccer/tennis, watching soccer/football, and hiking.

If you want more details, see the rest of the content in this page as well as my [projects page](/proj/).

## Education

### Undergraduate
I graduated from [Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/), in 2018 with a degree in computer science as well as a [rigorous, cross-disciplinary minor in data science](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/data-science-minor). During my time there I dabbled in a lot of things: 
* Did an internship in signal processing at the [Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/), a research organization which closely collaborates with the Air Force
    * Interns got to see the launch pad for a [Delta IV Heavy rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_IV_Heavy) in the summer that I worked there just a couple weeks before the rocket was set to take off!
* Rose through the ranks to become president of the data science club at Cal Poly
* Learned how to surf 
* Interned for a bit under a year (part time during terms with classes, full time during summer) at a local Amazon location on the Amazon prime team
    * Worked on backend code to ensure customers could receive their prime benefits
* Worked as a peer data science assistant at the campus library
* Briefly worked on a rather unorganized research project

### Graduate
After Cal Poly, I headed straight to grad school at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. I began research in the Dartmouth Security and Artificial Intelligence Lab immediately upon arrival, and began finishing projects, attending conferences and publishing work. Unfortunately, the relationship between myself and my advisor was not conducive to me being able to get work done consistently, leading to stress and disorganization. Further, as I spent more time in the academic environment, I simply researched that the work and schedule associated with most jobs that require a PhD (mostly the grant-writing and grinding for funding/submission deadlines) After struggling with the stress and disorganization this caused, I eventually realized that I had to leave the lab and attempt to get a Masters degree for my own mental health and success.

## Looking for work!
I am currently looking for employment as I will be completing my studies in November of 2021. I am looking for a position which will be full-time, with the requirement that I will have to work at most part-time during the period from September 12th, 2021 through December 5th, 2021 for my final academic term as a Masters student.

### What I am looking for
#### Location
I will need to either work remotely or  work at a location near [Hanover, NH](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=17CjOoKyKoYhu9KP5Ru1QmxcKKgM) until at least summer of 2022.

#### Position
I want to be in a position where I have a clear path for progression at the company. I work best when I am faced with a challenging problem, so I would prefer to work in a team which actively strives to innovate. I am primarily qualified for and looking for a position in designing/deploying machine learning algorithms and systems. I am also very interested in working in cybersecurity (as I recently took a very interesting graduate course on the topic) or the intersection between cybersecurity and machine learning. I would also be interested in positions involving data engineering or designing large-scale backend solutions.

### My qualifications
I have a Bachelor's degree from Cal Poly, SLO, where I majored in computer science and minored in data science.

I plan to finish a Master's degree in computer science at Dartmouth College by December 2021.

#### Coding skills
* I use Python (barring a few high-performance edge cases where I have used C++) in my machine learning work and for any small scripts I need to write. As such, most of my project work has been and will mostly continue to be in Python. 
* Proficient (if a bit rusty) with Java, having used it at Amazon in a system with very high transactions per second as part of the Prime team.
* Capable of writing C/C++ code well.
* Comfortable using LaTex and Markdown to generate documents.
* Getting better at using Git each day.
* Happy to learn new languages/frameworks.

#### Technical skills
* Experienced at organizing computation for reliable, parallelized computation on very large datasets. 
    * Processed ~4 TB of data in one social media project, in a set of computations which required thousands of CPU hours.
* Comfortable using and designing APIs.
    * Have done data scraping using pushshift, Reddit, Twitter, Google Cloud and other APIs, following rate limits where necessary.
    * When at Amazon, my team focused on maintaining and improving an internal API to handle Prime benefit requests for clients based on a customer's region and Prime type.
* Excellent at taking raw data and engineering a tidy, efficient form to use in the future.
* I design code in a modular style which minimizes duplication of code. This also leads to a project structure which is easy to understand and consequently easier to work with.
* Often complimented on the readability of my code


## Hobbies

### Skiing/snowboarding
I was very lucky to be afforded the opportunity to learn to ski at a very young age by my parents and a non-profit program at my school to offer subsidized ski/snowboard programs. Because of this, I have been skiing since I was a kid. Later on, I picked up snowboarding and liked it even better than skiing! I even taught both skiing and snowboarding at the local mountain while in high school in order to get my season pass. I still try to snowboard most weekends here in New Hampshire. When I lived on the central coast of California to attend Cal Poly, I had to give up snowboarding for years because it was almost 4 hours to the nearest mountain and I was busy with my studies.

### Surfing
To fill the void left behind by snowboarding, I decided to learn how to surf with some friends of mine. Four of us in all learned how to surf together purely through repetition. Eventually we got pretty good, and I fell in love with the sport. I enjoyed it so much I even ended up making my own surfboard in a program offered by Cal Poly. Unfortunately, since moving to New Hampshire to attend Dartmouth for grad school I have not been able to make the 4 hour round trip drive to go surfing. I would love to live near the coast again someday to be able to surf again

### Paddleboarding
Being located over an hour and a half from the ocean, Dartmouth is not a good place for a surfer. The beautiful lakes and rivers in the area, however, provided a fantastic place for me to learn how to paddleboard (by falling in - *a lot*). Paddleboarding has provided an excellent way to stay active and get out into nature, as well as some stunning views!

### Other hobbies
I try to stay fit by working out and playing soccer and tennis (though I am not particularly good at either). Though I played soccer since I was a kid, I only picked up tennis at 18. I also enjoy hiking, camping, watching soccer, watching football, and reading.
