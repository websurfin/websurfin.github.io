## Education

### Undergraduate
I graduated from [Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/), in 2018 with my Bachelor's in Computer Science as well as a [rigorous, cross-disciplinary minor in data science](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/data-science-minor). During my time there I did a lot to keep myself busy: 
* Worked as a research intern on a team which focused on signal processing at the [Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/), a research organization which closely collaborates with the Air Force.
    * Interns got to see the launch pad for a [Delta IV Heavy rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_IV_Heavy) in the summer that I worked there just a couple weeks before the rocket was set to take off!
    * My work ended in a term-length project in which I conducted a proof-of-concept for a physically-based preprocessing technique, where I showed the tradeoff between accuracy and time saved if we were to implement the technique.
* Served as treasurer, then president of the Data Science Club at Cal Poly, organizing recruting events and giving talks about machine learning concepts.
* Taught myself how to surf.
* Worked as a junior developer on the Amazon Prime team for a bit under a year (part time during terms with classes, full time during summer)
    * Worked on backend code to ensure customers could receive their prime benefits.
    * Rewrote and owned the code deployment and rollback pipeline which enabled our team to be able to react more quickly to issues in production. 
* Worked as a peer data science assistant at the campus library.
* Completed my senior project over two terms in collaboration with a local AI company, [Unanimous AI](https://unanimous.ai/).
* Completed my data science minor capstone project over two terms in collaboration with [FICO](https://fico.com/).

### Graduate
After Cal Poly, I headed straight to grad school at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/), pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. I began research in the Dartmouth Security and Artificial Intelligence Lab immediately upon arrival. In the first year, I spent much of my time writing code for experiments and reading hundreds of papers to prepare for writing research papers in the field of ML as applied to graph data and security problems. Toward the end of the first year and into my second year I began finishing projects, attending/presenting at conferences and publishing work. 

Unfortunately, the relationship between myself and my advisor was not conducive to me being able to get work done consistently, leading to stress and disorganization. Further, as I spent more time in the academic environment, I simply realized that the work and schedule associated with most jobs that require a PhD (mostly the grant-writing and grinding for funding/submission deadlines) did not match up with my passions. 

After struggling with the stress, disillusionment, and disorganization this caused, I eventually realized that I had to leave the lab and attempt to get a master's degree for my own mental health and success. I completed the degree requirements for a Master's in Computer Science in the fall term of 2021 at Dartmouth.

## Looking for work!
I am currently looking for employment, available to start immediately. I am looking for a position which will be full-time, with a focus on applied computation/backend development. In the applied computation space, I am most interested in data science, machine learning, cybersecurity/cryptography, social network analysis, and physical simulation, but I have a passion for thoroughly optimizing code designed for big data problems. In backend development, I would be most interested in architecture and design of elegant software solutions, as I have always enjoyed the finer points of abstraction and modularization. That said, I lack the industry experience needed for those sort of positions - for now - and am happy to do any backend or applied computation software engineering work to get the necessary experience.

### What I am looking for
#### Location
I am open to remote work, as well as relocation to most locations (provided some tips or assistance on moving/finding lodging in town). I do have a preference to work remotely through 09/2022 if possible. I also have a preference for coastal California, due to my time spent there and friends/family that still live there.

#### Position
I want to be in a position where I have a clear path for progression at the company. I work best when I am faced with a challenging problem, so I would prefer to work in a team which actively strives to innovate. I am primarily qualified for and looking for a position in designing/deploying machine learning algorithms and systems. I am also very interested in working in cybersecurity (as I recently took a very interesting graduate course on the topic) or the intersection between cybersecurity and machine learning. I would also be interested in positions involving data engineering or designing large-scale backend solutions.

### My qualifications
I have a Bachelor's degree from Cal Poly, SLO, where I majored in computer science and minored in data science.

I have completed a Master's in Computer Science at Dartmouth College, with degree conferral expected soon.

#### Coding skills
* I use Python (barring heavily used computational code or GPU code - where I will use C++) in my machine learning work and for any small scripts I need to write. As such, most of my project work has been and will mostly continue to be in Python. 
* Proficient (if a bit rusty) with Java, having used it throughout my undergraduate education as well as during my one year junior developer position at Amazon in a system with very high transactions per second as part of the Prime team.
* Proficient with C/C++ (and planning to learn Rust soon) and comfortable using Makefiles to specify dependencies.
* Comfortable using LaTex and Markdown to generate tidy documents.
* Competent with Git and getting better at using it each day.
* Happy to learn new languages/frameworks.

#### Technical skills
* Experience with organizing computation for reliable, parallelized computation on very large datasets. 
    * Processed ~4 TB of data in one social media project, in a set of computations which required thousands of CPU hours.
* Comfortable using and designing APIs.
    * Have done data scraping using pushshift, Reddit, Twitter, Google Cloud and other APIs, following rate limits where necessary.
    * When at Amazon, my team focused on maintaining and improving an internal API to handle Prime benefit requests for clients based on a customer's region and Prime type.
* Excellent at taking raw data and engineering a tidy, efficient form to use in the future.
    * Proved crucial when managing thousands of computation jobs on somewhat unreliable computation cluster.
    * Key skill I gained was designing appropriate data artifacts, allowing my programs to identify missing/errant artifacts and run computation as necessary.
* I design code in a modular style which minimizes duplication of code. This also leads to a project structure which is easy to understand and consequently easier to work with.
    * Often complimented on the readability of my code


## Hobbies

### Skiing/snowboarding
I was very lucky to be afforded the opportunity to learn to ski at a very young age by my parents and a non-profit program at my school to offer subsidized ski/snowboard programs. Because of this, I have been skiing since I was a kid. Later on, I picked up snowboarding and liked it even better than skiing! I even taught both skiing and snowboarding at the local mountain while in high school in order to get my season pass. I still try to snowboard most weekends here in New Hampshire. When I lived on the central coast of California to attend Cal Poly, I had to give up snowboarding for years because it was almost 4 hours to the nearest mountain and I was busy with my studies.

### Surfing
To fill the void left behind by snowboarding, I decided to learn how to surf with some friends of mine. Four of us in all learned how to surf together purely through repetition. Eventually we got pretty good, and I fell in love with the sport. I enjoyed it so much I even ended up making my own surfboard in a program offered by Cal Poly. Unfortunately, since moving to New Hampshire to attend Dartmouth for grad school I have not been able to make the 4 hour round trip drive to go surfing. I would love to live near the coast again someday to be able to surf again

### Paddleboarding
Being located over an hour and a half from the ocean, Dartmouth is not a good place for a surfer. The beautiful lakes and rivers in the area, however, provided a fantastic place for me to learn how to paddleboard (by falling in - *a lot*). Paddleboarding has provided an excellent way to stay active and get out into nature, as well as some stunning views!

### Other hobbies
I try to stay fit by working out and playing soccer and tennis (though I am not particularly good at either). Though I played soccer since I was a kid, I only picked up tennis at 18. I also enjoy hiking, camping, watching soccer, watching football, and reading.
