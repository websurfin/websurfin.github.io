Hi there, I am Tommy White.

Originally from Seattle, I spent four years completing my bachelor's degree in California before 
moving out to NH for graduate school.

## Looking for work!
I am currently looking for employment as I will be completing
my studies in November of 2021. 

Ideally, I would be able to work full-time until the academic term starts, part-time during my 
final academic term, then return to full-time after the term ends. I will need to work either 
remotely or near 
[Hanover, NH](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=17CjOoKyKoYhu9KP5Ru1QmxcKKgM) as well until
at least summer of 2022.
