***Note**: This post is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue applying to different companies over the coming month.*
In this article, I aim to answer the basic questions about what I look for when I am looking for a CS position. This should be helpful as a reflective piece for myself, a way for potential employers to gauge the 'fit' of me at their company, and a way for other future CS professionals to get another perspective on the hiring process.

## The company

### Potential for future innovations

### Stability

### History of promoting from within

### Competitive benefits


## The position

### Challenging problem-solving

### Room for professional development

### The team
It is difficult to know how well you will fit into a team at an industry workplace ahead of time. Even if you met all of the people and understood the position perfectly beforehand, there is no way to predict the inevitable growing pains that the team will go through when a new person joins. That said, there are some important questions to ask during the interview:
* What is the team's process for handling work which is both urgent and important?
  * Is there someone on call? How are on-call rotations determined if so?


## Location

### Based on hobbies

### Based on livability

### Other factors
