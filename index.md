Welcome to my portfolio website and perhaps a blog someday! 

My name is Tommy. I have recently completed my Master's in Computer Science at Dartmouth. I came here originally as a PhD student, and I worked in a high-paced and challenging research environment for just over two years, before the pandemic made me realize the value of the peace of mind provided by the stable income in industry. I finished my time at Dartmouth taking a variety of challenging project courses in applied computation (rendering algorithms, concurrent algorithms, security/privacy of machine learning, etc.) in order to prepare me for a transition into industry where I could be prepared for work in most applied computing fields. I am excited to begin working on real-world problems again rather than theory.

Take a look around, you can find more information about me in the `About` tab above, information about my projects in the `Projects` tab, contact information in the `Contact` tab as well as in the footer, and my blog posts listed further down on this page (none yet, but a few are in the works!).
