Welcome to my portfolio website and beginnings of a blog! My name is Tommy. I am currently a Masters student in computer science at Dartmouth, where I have focused my education and research around the applications of machine learning to the cybersecurity space. The next step forward for me is to transition into industry and begin working on real-world problems rather than theory.

Take a look around, you can find more information about me in the `About` tab above, information about my projects in the `Projects` tab above, contact information in the `Contact` tab above as well as in the footer, and my blog posts listed further down on this page.
